Features
Data Preprocessing: The data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook focuses on cleaning the raw dataset, handling missing values, and performing feature engineering. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is also conducted to understand the distribution of variables and identify potential patterns.

Model Training: The model_training.ipynb notebook implements the data loading pipeline, trains a predictive machine learning model using the preprocessed data, and evaluates its performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Custom Model: The model.py script in the src directory defines a custom machine learning model architecture tailored for the hotel booking price prediction task. The architecture can be easily replaced with other models for experimentation.

Data Loader: The data_loader.py script provides functions to load and preprocess data, making it convenient to integrate data handling into various parts of the project.
